A round object didn't look right on a real SNES, due to slightly un-square pixels. The aspect ratio is 8/7 so I resized the moon to 112x128

128x7/8=112

MESEN-S must be set to video / aspect ratio 8/7 to see it the same.

The image was then made 256 pixels wide so superfamiconv produces a correct map.
Also, reduced indexed to 16 color, then saved as png with NO compression.
